         <h1>Binary search tree :</h1>
         <p>A binary search tree follows some order to arrange the elements like the value of left node must be smaller than the parent node,
            and the value of right node must be greater than the parent node. 
        </p>

        <h2>Advantages of Binary search tree :</h2>
        <p>
            Searching an element in the Binary search tree is easy as we always have a hint that which subtree has the desired element.
        </p>
        <p>
            As compared to array and linked lists, insertion and deletion operations are faster in BST
        </p>

        <h2>Disadvantages of Binary search tree :</h2>
        <p>
            The complexity of a BST might rise if it becomes unbalanced or degenerates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Disable several operations that can be performed on ordered data structures.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Searching: For searching element 1, we have to traverse all elements (in order 3, 2, 1). Therefore, searching in binary search tree has worst case complexity of O(n). 
                In general, the time complexity is O(h) where h is the height of BST.
            </li>
            <li>
                Insertion: For inserting element 0, it must be inserted as the left child of 1. Therefore, we need to traverse all elements (in order 3, 2, 1) to insert 0 which has the worst-case complexity of O(n). 
                In general, the time complexity is O(h).
            </li>
            <li>
                Deletion: For deletion of element 1, we have to traverse all elements to find 1 (in order 3, 2, 1). Therefore, deletion in binary tree has worst case complexity of O(n). 
                In general, the time complexity is O(h).
