        <h1>Trie :</h1>
        <p> Trie is a type of k-ary search tree used for storing and searching a specific key from a set. 
            Using Trie, search complexities can be brought to optimal limit (key length). 
        </p>

       <h2>Advantages of Trie:</h2>
       <p>
        Trie allows us to input and finds strings in O(l) time, where l is the length of a single word. 
        It is faster as compared to both hash tables and binary search trees.
       </p>
       <p>
        It provides alphabetical filtering of entries by the key of the node and hence makes it easier to print all words in alphabetical order.
       </p>

       <h2>Disadvantages of Trie</h2>
       <p>
        The main disadvantage of the trie is that it takes a lot of memory to store all the strings. 
        For each node, we have too many node pointers which are equal to the no of characters in the worst case.
       </p>
       <p>
        An efficiently constructed hash table(i.e. a good hash function and a reasonable load factor) 
        has O(1) as lookup time which is way faster than O(l) in the case of a trie, 
        where l is the length of the string.
       </p>
